Accessible & SEO-Friendly Web Page
Overview
This project is a single HTML5 web page designed to demonstrate modern web development practices, focusing on semantic HTML5 structure, accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO). The page serves as a showcase for creating user-friendly, inclusive, and discoverable web content using only HTML5, without CSS or JavaScript.

Features
Semantic HTML5 Structure: Utilizes semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and <address> to create a well-organized and meaningful page layout.
Accessibility Enhancements: Incorporates ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-current) to improve navigation for assistive technologies like screen readers.
SEO Optimization: Includes metadata (description, keywords, author) and a logical heading hierarchy (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>) to enhance search engine discoverability.
Clear Content: Provides descriptive, human-readable text for users and search engine crawlers, with a focus on clarity and relevance.

File Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the web page structure and content.

Prerequisites
A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to view the HTML file.
No additional tools or libraries are required, as the project uses pure HTML5.

How to Use
Download or Clone the Project:
Save the index.html file to your local machine.
Open the File:
Double-click index.html to open it in your default web browser, or
Serve it locally using a simple web server (e.g., Python's http.server):python -m http.server 8000
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
Explore the Page:
Navigate through the sections (Home, About, Services, Contact) using the navigation menu.
Test accessibility features with a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to verify compatibility.
Inspect the source code to review semantic structure and SEO metadata.
